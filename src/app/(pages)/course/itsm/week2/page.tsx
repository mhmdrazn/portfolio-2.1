Services succeed or fail depending on how people are organized, whether they trust each other, and if they have the right skills and roles. For example, without clear responsibilities, even the best-designed IT system can become chaotic.'

This showed me that technology is not only about functionality but also about quality. Services are only valuable if the information they produce is accurate, secure, and available when needed.

I worked with terms like create, deliver, automation, adoption, changing demand, sequence, and interrelated actions. This shows how ITSM is not random but structured, each activity from request handling to incident resolution must be defined and aligned with outcomes. I found it interesting how automation is emphasized since modern ITSM increasingly relies on automation to adapt to fast-changing user demands.'

Highlighting keywords like trust, reliability, collaboration, and automation helped me see how each dimension carries its own weight but also interlocks with the others. What stood out most is how fragile the balance can be. If one dimension is neglected, the others quickly suffer. For example, unreliable technology undermines trust, while weak processes waste the efforts of competent people. This week taught me that ITSM is not just about managing IT but about orchestrating a whole ecosystem where every dimension matters.'
