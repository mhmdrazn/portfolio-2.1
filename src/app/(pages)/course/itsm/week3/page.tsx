The SVS describes how all components and activities of an organization work together to co-create value, ensuring that IT services are not managed in isolation but as part of a holistic ecosystem. What stood out for me this week was how the SVS connects everything: guiding principles, governance, the service value chain, continual improvement, and practices. It is not just a model on paper but a way to see IT services as a living system that adapts to demand and opportunity.'

The SVS taught me to view ITSM as an interconnected system where guiding principles, governance, and practices all reinforce one another. The email migration case was especially eye-opening, as I could trace how a demand turned into real value through the service value chain. The chatbot and Wi-Fi scenarios showed that ITSM problems often reveal weaknesses in visibility and collaboration rather than just technology. This week gave me a sense that ITIL is not a rigid framework but a flexible toolkit, and learning how to apply it will be key to solving future challenges.'
